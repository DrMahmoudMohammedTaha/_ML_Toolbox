The VGG convolutional neural network architecture, named for the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford, was an important milestone in the use of deep learning methods for computer vision.

The key innovation in this architecture was the definition and repetition of what we will refer to as VGG-blocks. These are groups of convolutional layers that use small filters (e.g. 3×3 pixels) followed by a max pooling layer.

VGG19 is a variant of VGG model which in short consists of 19 layers (16 convolution layers, 3 Fully connected layer, 5 MaxPool layers and 1 SoftMax layer). There are other variants of VGG like VGG11, VGG16 and others. VGG19 has 19.6 billion FLOPs.
Compared with VGG16, VGG19 is slightly better but requests more memory

• A fixed size of (224 * 224) RGB image was given as input to this network which means that the matrix was of shape (224,224,3).


Output of this network is classification of 1000 classes of imageNet dataset
